            I am a highly motivated individual who thrives on tackling
            challenges and solving tough problems. I am excited to tell you that
            I have graduated at the South African College of Psychology.
            Currently I am furthering my education at Hyperion Development, with
            the aim of advancing my career within the field of Information
            Technology and I am engaging in uber eats to help sustain myself
            financially.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now that I have graduated, I am using the skills learned in
            psychology to sell services that assist clients to develop
            strategies for their personal goals and enable them to communicate
            their goals more effectively between their services providers to
            ensure better productivity.
          </p>
          <p>
            Currently I am engaging in delivering services through Uber Eats to
            sustain myself financially My journey within the realm of Psychology
            has equipped me with a wide array of skills. These capabilities
            empower me not only to effectively communicate with individuals,
            ensuring they feel acknowledged and heard, but also to facilitate
            productive dialogue among team members, thereby mitigating potential
            misunderstandings within the workplace. Furthermore, I have honed my
            ability to work collaboratively within teams, embrace diverse
            perspectives, and stay attuned to emerging social trends.

          Quantum Foods outsourced me as a Data Handler. I was given the
          responsibility to handle and re-organize their digital data and to
          enhance the performance of their data handling software. This was a
          2-month project which I successfully completed.

        <p>
          As an advocate for open communication and equal opportunities for all,
          I actively contributed as a student counsellor at the Salesian
          Institute Youth Project. In this capacity, I provided individual
          support to students between the ages of 14 to 18, hailing from
          underprivileged backgrounds, by creating a safe and open environment
          where they could freely express their thoughts and share any concerns
          they had.
        </p>
        <p>
          Leveraging my keen ability to assess character, I was entrusted with
          the responsibility of interviewing and evaluating prospective students
          seeking admission to the Salesian Institute Youth Project. I employed
          a set of predefined questions and exercised the discretion to
          formulate my own inquiries, thereby shaping my assessment of
          candidates based on their responses.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my role as a Student Counsellor, I demonstrated strong teamwork
          skills and was actively involved in the development of workshops
          designed to equip students with new life skills. Throughout the
          workshop creation process, I conducted research and offered valuable
          input to enhance the content and delivery of these educational
          sessions.

        <p>
          As a profoundly motivated individual, I undertook the task of
          restructuring Garden Cities' document repository. My responsibilities
          included assessing and categorizing files for archival preservation or
          disposal.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, I played a pivotal role in the refurbishment of Garden
          Cities' document storage facility. I actively contributed by proposing
          innovative ideas for the redesign of the storage area. This
          encompassed dismantling outdated shelving units, constructing new
          ones, and offering fresh insights on how to optimize file organization
          to facilitate seamless accessibility.
        </p>

        <p>
          As an avid learner, I engaged in a job shadowing experience with a
          Software Administrator at Garden Cities. This invaluable opportunity
          allowed me to gain insights into the intricacies of digital data
          storage and its implementation through SQL data management.
          Furthermore, during this experience, I had the privilege of acquiring
          proficiency in C++ programming by providing technical assistance to
          employees when software applications failed to integrate seamlessly
          with their computer systems.
